# ESCAPE FROM TITANIC

The game presents us a DOT, who is caught in the sinking Titanic. He has to get on the on the deck as fast as he can because the lifeboats are limited. He doesn't know how to swim, so if the water catches him, he is dead.

The dot will have to face a lot of levels, some of them harder than others.

### Technical details
  * the player will have 3 lifes at the beginning, but if he moves fast enough and finishes the level with a high score he will get one life if he doesn't have 3 already
  * the faster he finishes the level, the higher the score will be. There are also bonus dots, who will give points for score
  * every second matters because at higher levels, Titanic will sink faster
  * there will be a TOP 3 highscore menu, which will be saved to EEPROM with no option to reset the highscores
